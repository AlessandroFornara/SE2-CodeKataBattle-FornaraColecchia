Alphabetical Word Sorter

Objective:
Develop a Java program that reads a list of words from a file (specified as a command-line argument) and prints these words in alphabetical order. Each word in the file is on a new line.

Requirements:

Input: The program should accept the filename as a command-line argument. The specified file will contain one word per line. Words can consist of any character and are case-sensitive.

Sorting: The words should be sorted in alphabetical order. Consider the sorting to be case-sensitive, meaning capital letters come before lowercase letters (e.g., "Apple" would come before "apple").

Output: Print the sorted list of words to the console, with each word on a new line in its original case.

Example:

Given an input file (words.txt) containing:

Banana
apple
Orange
grape

The expected console output should be:

Banana
Orange
apple
grape
