Palindrome Checker

Objective:
Write a Java program that reads a list of strings from a file and determines whether each string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring cases, spaces, and punctuation.

Requirements:

Input File: Your program should read from a file named input.txt. This file will contain one string per line. The contents of the file could range from single words to complete sentences.

Normalization: Before checking if a string is a palindrome, you must normalize the string. This involves:
-Removing all non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).
-Converting all letters to lowercase.

Palindrome Check: 
Implement a method to check if a given string is a palindrome. This method should compare characters in the string from the beginning and the end, moving towards the center. If all corresponding characters match, the string is a palindrome.

Output: For each string read from the file, print the original string followed by : true if it is a palindrome or : false if it is not. Each result should be printed on a new line.

Example:

Input file (input.txt):

Madam
racecar
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama
hello

Expected output:

Madam: true
racecar: true
A man, a plan, a canal: Panama: true
hello: false
